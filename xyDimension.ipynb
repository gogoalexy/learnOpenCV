However, we draw the line from point (10, 10) to (400, 200), and it is downward-slope which implies the origin, that is, (0, 0) locates at the upper-left corner and the positive direction of y-axis is pointing downward.\n",

    "In conclusion, to be compatible with general matrix operations, the image array in OpenCV is stored in a row-major way. On the other hand, the point notation takes the same origin point of the image array, and the y-axis is designed as image array compatible, i.e. if x=column and y=row, it denotes the same point. Furthermore, even the (x, y) value represents a vector rather than a single point; it still follows the same convention."
